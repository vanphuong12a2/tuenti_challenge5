The explanation of how I solved it:
  1. View the cookies to get the config value 
  2. Create a database with a table contain my login data
  3. Change the cookies:
    + config: the database authentication infomation is my database's information
    + sig: encode from secret ('x') and my new config value
  4. Log in with the user data from my database
